# Frequently Asked Questions

_Why is my project/target not considered at imaging time?_

> Be sure your project is in the Active state and the current date is between the project start/end dates.  In the management UI, click the profile name containing the project to show all projects.  The project should have a green checkmark if it's truly active.

_My target is active but still isn't being considered for imaging - why?_

> There could be many reasons:
> - It might not have risen about the horizon.
> - The current level of darkness might be inappropriate for the defined exposure plans/templates.
> - The project/target may have scored lower than others so the imaging time was allotted elsewhere.

_Why can't I import a target from my planetarium software?_

> Import from planetarium software will only work if the software is properly configured in NINA Options > Equipment.  If import isn't working in the Framing Assistant, it's not going to work for target import.
