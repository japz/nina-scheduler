#### Modal Editing
Editing projects, targets, etc in the management UI uses a _modal editing_ approach (unlike the rest of the NINA UI).  You must click the Edit icon to enter edit mode, make your changes, and then Save or Cancel.  This is necessary to avoid excessive database commits and ensure database integrity.
