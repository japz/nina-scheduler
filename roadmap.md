## Future Development

* Ability to import a target from a NINA sequence target.
* Since the Scheduler will know what images were acquired throughout a session, it could potentially generate the details to automatically take the associated flats.  Perhaps a new sequence instruction based on the existing Trained Flat Exposure instruction.
* Support undo/redo operations in the database (maybe).
